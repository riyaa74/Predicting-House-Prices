# Predicting-House-Prices
Predicting House Prices with Regression using TensorFlow
---

For this project, we are going to work on evaluating price of houses given the following features:

1. Year of sale of the house
2. The age of the house at the time of sale
3. Distance from city center
4. Number of stores in the locality
5. The latitude
6. The longitude

This notebook uses `python 3` and these packages: `tensorflow`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.

The project on Predicting House Prices is divided into following tasks:

**Task 1: Introduction**<br>
1.Introduction to the house pricing problem.<br>
2.Importing libraries and helper functions.

**Task 2:The Dataset**<br>
1.Importing the dataset.<br>
2.Check missing data.

**Task 3:Data Normalization**<br>
1.Data normalization.<br>
2.Convert label values back to prices.

**Task 4:Training and Test Sets**<br>
1.Select features.<br>
2.Select labels.<br>
3.Convert from Pandas data structures to numpy arrays.<br>
4.Train and test split.

**Task 5:Creating the Model**<br>
1.Creating a sequential model with Keras.<br>
2.Model architecture - hidden layers and hidden units.<br>
3.Compiling the model by specifying an optimizer and a loss function.<br>
4.Computing trainable parameters.

**Task 6:Model Training**<br>
1.Training the model to fit to training data.<br>
2.Plotting training and validation loss.

**Task 7:Predictions**<br>
1.Plot and compare raw predictions.<br>
2.Plot and compare price predictions
